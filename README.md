# Mail Auto Delete
A simple addon for *The Elder Scrolls Online* for deleting mails on collecting attachments.

ESO has a mail limit in the mailbox. If you receive a lot of mail with attachments you should delete them manually to keep receiving new mails. It can be annoying. So the addon simply deletes a mail after you collect attachments.
